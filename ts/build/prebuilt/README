README for creating prebuilt Thinstation installers
===================================================
Updated: 5 July, 2008 by Trevor B

The simplest way is to run
./prebuilt/tools/make_prebuilts.sh
from your Thinstation-<ver> directory.

This will build the various images for each prebuilt type and create the 
Windows & linux installers for them in the prebuilt/installers 
directory.

Installers are named 
Thinstation-<ver>-<type>.<category>-Setup.exe (for Windows) and 
Thinstation-<ver>-<type>.<category>.Linux-Install (for Linux).

The installer is generated by InstallJammer (http://InstallJammer.com),
and a copy of this software will need to be installed in 
prebuilt/tools/installjammer. The first time through, the make_prebuilts.sh
script will ask if you want to install the included copy.

The version used for the current builds is 1.2.15.

The associated InstallJammer configuration files are held in the various 
prebuilt/<type>/<categ>/BuildFiles directories. These can be editted via
the InstallJammer software once installed.

There are various options on the prebuilt/tools/make_prebuilts.sh script
that can be found by running:
./prebuilt/tools/make_prebuilts.sh --help

Have fun
