To make a bootable Thinstation CD:

Burn "thinstation.iso" directly as an image. In linux just run "cdrecord thinstation.iso".
To burn the CD in  MS Windows you need to select "burn image" or similar.
Do NOT burn "thinstation.iso" as a plain file! 

Thinstation supports the 9660/El Torito CD boot format using isolinux 
(http://syslinux.zytor.com/iso.php). A floppy image and floppy compatibility style is not used.
