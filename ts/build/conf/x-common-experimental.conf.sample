#**** EXPERIMENTAL ****
# Dual Head Support
#
# This allows two seperate X sessions to be started with seperate input devices.  This allows
# effectively two seperate machines within the same PC.  You will need seperate screen cards
# to enable this.  It is best to use with 1 AGP card and 1 PCI card.

# Check out http://www.ltn.lv/~aivils/eng-video.html for a list of known compatable screen cards

# Input Device support should be:
#
# Primary mouse and keyboard PS/2
# Secondary mouse and keyboard USB
#
# There is some basic detection scripts for this, but these will need to be improved in TS 3.0.
# If thinstation doesn't detect both a USB keyboard and mouse it will default back to dual
# screen support, not dual head.
#
# This is not considered stable.  If you exit the session, or try to change to a console screen
# with Alt-F1 etc... it will probably crash the machine.  If it doesn't work with your hardware
# there is nothing that can be done about it.

# The kernel Advanced Power Management module is disabled when using dual screen as it causes the
# second screen to crash.

# Note the below option only supports 1-2, anything more than two won't work.  This is provided
# for future development, to create a machine with more than two seperate sessions.

# SESSION_#_SCREEN_POSITION 1-X When using dual screen support you can specify the position
#                               of each session.  This allows to seperate sessions to be on
#                               seperate screens.  If only 1 session is in use, this option will
#                               make no differnece.  You can specify between 1+ positions
