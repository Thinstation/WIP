# This is the default configuration for the libblockdev library. For
# each supported technology/plugin there is a separate section/group
# with the 'sonames' key. The value of the key has to be a list of
# sonames of shared objects that should be attempted to be loaded for
# the plugin falling back to the next one in the list.
#
# So this example:
# [lvm]
# sonames=libbd_lvm-dbus.so.0;libbd_lvm.so.0
#
# would result in the libbd_lvm-dbus.so.0 shared object attempted to
# be loaded and if that failed, the libbd_lvm.so.0 would be attempted
# to be loaded.
