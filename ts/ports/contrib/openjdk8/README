NOTES:
=====

* These are the links to the unversioned files:

http://icedtea.wildebeest.org/download/drops/icedtea8/$icedtea_version/{corba,hotspot,jaxp,jaxws,langtools,nashorn,openjdk}.tar.xz
http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-release/raw-file/$certdata_rev/security/nss/lib/ckfw/builtins/certdata.txt
http://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/pkgsrc-$pkgsrc_quarter/pkgsrc/security/mozilla-rootcerts/files/mozilla-rootcerts.sh

 The mirrorred and versioned files are merely renamed to prevent signature mismatches and files
 not being downloaded due to older, unversioned files stopping the correct file from being retrieved.

* The following packages do not exist but might be nice to have:

pcsc-lite, lksctp-tools

 (Actually, I have private ports for these, but need to determine if there is
 any actual benefit from adding and depending on them).


TODO:
====

* Add script(s) for setting the java environment. Or, perhaps in a post-install?

* Concider generic java packages that allow to have different java env installed
  and be able to switch between them via script: 'java-choose icedtea7' or
  'java-choose gcj-jdk' or 'java-choose jdk8', etc, etc...

* Do testing beyond just running java programs like eclipse and minecraft.
